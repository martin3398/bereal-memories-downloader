Small tool to download all your memories from BeReal.

## Setup
You can obtain the token by logging in to BeReal and inspecting the network traffic. The token is sent at some point to the API.
You can also obtain a new token by using the SMS verification method of BeReal (not yet included in this project).

Please include your token (as jwt) and the data directory in the `config.yaml` file. 

You can start the script with `python3 main.py`.
